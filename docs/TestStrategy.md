This document outlines the testing strategy for the FinQA banking application, detailing the approach, scope, resources, and schedule for testing activities. The strategy ensures a comprehensive validation of the application's functionality, performance, security, and usability.

### 1.2 Scope
The FinQA Automation Framework covers:
- User interface testing
- API testing
- Database validation
- Visual validation
- Cross-browser/platform testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### 1.3 References
- System Requirements Specification
- Software Design Document
- OWASP Testing Guidelines
- Banking Software Security Standards

## 2. Test Approach

### 2.1 Test Levels

#### 2.1.1 Unit Testing
- **Approach**: Component-level testing by developers using JUnit
- **Coverage**: All business logic, services, and utilities
- **Automation**: 100% of unit tests are automated

#### 2.1.2 Integration Testing
- **Approach**: Service-to-service interaction testing using RestAssured
- **Coverage**: All API endpoints and service interactions
- **Automation**: 95% of integration tests are automated

#### 2.1.3 System Testing
- **Approach**: End-to-end testing of complete user journeys using Selenium
- **Coverage**: Core business workflows and user journeys
- **Automation**: 80% of system tests are automated

#### 2.1.4 Acceptance Testing
- **Approach**: Behavior-driven testing with Cucumber
- **Coverage**: Key business scenarios and acceptance criteria
- **Automation**: 75% of acceptance tests are automated

### 2.2 Test Types

#### 2.2.1 Functional Testing
- User authentication and authorization
- Account management
- Fund transfers
- Transaction history
- Alerts and notifications

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and endurance testing using JMeter
- **Security Testing**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- **Usability Testing**: User experience evaluation
- **Compatibility Testing**: Browser and device compatibility

#### 2.2.3 Specialized Testing
- **Visual Testing**: UI appearance validation using screenshot comparison
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Localization Testing**: Multi-language support
